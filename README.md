# umbrella-repo-p5
This is an umbrella repository for P5.js projects. Creating visuals and graphics is a hobby of mine and this repo will reflect my journey getting familiar with P5.js.  
Functions also as a playground to practice commit-tags and moving between them as different stages of graphics development might look more interesting  and offer new ideas when revisited at a later time.
